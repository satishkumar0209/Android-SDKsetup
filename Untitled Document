Before we start 

1)Mobile device with usb driver
2)Mobile application APK
3)Appium set up
4)Android SDK
5)Selenium standalone server jar files and webdriver script.


Mobile set up:

Enable the developer options--->setting-->
developer option-->
selct check box(Stake away check box)-->
Again select the select box (Usb Debugging)
Now developer option set in your mobile.


2)Mobile application APK
Take any APK save in your computer and same APK install in your phone.

3)Appium set up:
Download Appium from appium official site.


4)Download Android sdk(32/64 bit)
Need to download from android offcial site.Kept it one folder
We need to set path of two folders
1)Platform tools
2)Tools

Open terminal-->type adb (Getting this type of error messsage(adb is currently not installed) 
Again--->Type android(Getting this type of error messsage(android:command not found))
Why because path is not set.you have to set the path then only you can use the android sdk

Go to android sdk folder-->platform tools--->Here you can see adb file -->press Ctrl+l(you can see the address in address bar)
Copy the address 
Go to home folder
Search for (.bashrc)
In android sdk,There are multiple hidden files 
so you have to show hidden files(press control+h)
Now open .bashrc-->
Double click
scroll down completelly
Bottom of the screen you can see fi

press enter


Write the following :
export PATH=$PATH:'paste'(control s)
Samething follow the tools:

Finally you can write one line like this 
Example: export PATH=#PATH:'platform tools path':'tools path'(save the file).
Now android sdk path is set
Now open your terminal'
type
Adb
Now you getting all commands for adb


Now writ eyour programme in eclipse

5)Download selenium standalone server jar files and download java client jar files

These jar files attach to your eclipse project.

6)write your script

String AppPath = "/home/aj/Pictures/yicuu.apk";
		
	@Test
	public void createAppiumInstance() throws InterruptedException 
	{
		try
		{
			
			DesiredCapabilities caps = new DesiredCapabilities();
//Set the device name
			caps.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.DEVICE_NAME, "Redmi");	
//set the android version
			caps.setCapability("version", "4.4.4");
			caps.setCapability("app", AppPath);
			caps.setCapability("newCommandTimeout", "12000");
//Set the appium server 
			driver = new AndroidDriver(new URL("http://0.0.0.0:4723/wd/hub/"),caps);
			driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
			
		}
		catch(Exception e)
		{
			System.out.println("Appium session is not created" + e);
		}
	
		
	
		driver.findElementByXPath("//android.view.View[@content-desc='Skip']").click();
	
	}
}

Once your script is completed
Before running your script.you have to start appium server.
